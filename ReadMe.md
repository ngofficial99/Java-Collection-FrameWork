# Java Basics, Generics, Collection Framework, and DSA Repository

This repository contains my code and learning materials related to **Java Basics**, **Generics**, the **Java Collection Framework**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**. It's an evolving project designed to enhance my understanding of core Java concepts and their application in real-world programming.

## Structure

- **Collection-framwork/src**: Contains source code for various implementations of Java collection classes like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, etc.
- **bin**: Compiled Java bytecode from the source files.

## Resources and References

Throughout my learning journey, I utilized the following valuable resources, which helped build my foundational knowledge in Java and DSA:

1. **Java Basics and Generics**:  
   I learned Java basics and Generics using [this video](https://youtu.be/UypoeUL4T_U?si=E-ZJDHcRKfD6KCJk) from *Engineering Digest*. This video series explains the essentials of Java programming and dives into Generics, a powerful feature that enables type-safe data structures and methods.

2. **Java Collection Framework**:  
   For the Collection Framework, I followed [this video](https://youtu.be/VE_AAUxTUCY?si=qq6VIlfV1zydK0w4) from *Riddhi Dutta*. This tutorial gives a detailed walkthrough of the Collection classes in Java, such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, and more, along with practical examples.

3. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**:  
   To get started with DSA, I used [this video](https://youtu.be/xWLxhF3b5P8?si=1kb-hLWHaYTrQSpu) from *Telusko*. The video series covers various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and algorithms that are critical for coding interviews and real-world applications.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ngofficial99/Java-Collection-FrameWork.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `src` folder, where you'll find code implementations.
3. Compile and run the Java programs using your preferred IDE or the command line.

## Acknowledgments
